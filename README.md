# Parrot Bebop

Work in progress!
Building a driver for the Parrot Bebop 2 drone in Go.

The idea behind writing this new driver, was to have a new driver in Go that can utilize all the functions and sensors the Parrot Bebop provide.

Alongside the driver is also a lexer and parser that will take the whole xml of the AR Protocol Specification and parse it into Go code.
That package can be found here <https://github.com/postmannen/lexmlparser>
